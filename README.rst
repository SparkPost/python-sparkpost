The super-mega-official Python package for using the SparkPost API.


Installation
------------

Install from PyPI using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sparkpost

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/


Get a key
---------

Go to `API & SMTP`_ in the SparkPost app and create an API key. We recommend using the ``SPARKPOST_API_KEY`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    sp = SparkPost() # uses environment variable

Alternatively, you can pass the API key to the SparkPost class:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    sp = SparkPost('YOUR API KEY')
    
.. _API & SMTP: https://app.sparkpost.com/#/configuration/credentials


Send a message
--------------

Here at SparkPost, our messages are known as transmissions. Let's use the underlying `transmissions API`_ to send a friendly test message:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    
    sp = SparkPost()
    
    response = sp.transmission.send(
        recipients=['someone@somedomain.com'],
        html='<p>Hello world</p>',
        from_email='test@sparkpostbox.com',
        subject='Hello from python-sparkpost'
    )
    
    print response
    # outputs {u'total_accepted_recipients': 1, u'id': u'47960765679942446', u'total_rejected_recipients': 0}
