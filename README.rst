The official Python package for using the SparkPost API.

Documentation
-------------

* Documentation for `python-sparkpost`_
* `SparkPost API Reference`_

.. _python-sparkpost: https://python-sparkpost.readthedocs.io/
.. _SparkPost API Reference: https://www.sparkpost.com/api

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sparkpost

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

Python 2.7 or later is required.

Get a key
---------

Go to `API & SMTP`_ in the SparkPost app and create an API key. We recommend using the ``SPARKPOST_API_KEY`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    sp = SparkPost() # uses environment variable

Alternatively, you can pass the API key to the SparkPost class:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    sp = SparkPost('YOUR API KEY')

For SparkPost EU and Enterprise accounts, pass in a second parameter to set the API host.

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost
    sp = SparkPost('YOUR API KEY', 'https://api.eu.sparkpost.com')

.. _API & SMTP: https://app.sparkpost.com/#/configuration/credentials


Send a message
--------------

Here at SparkPost, our messages are known as transmissions. Let's use the underlying `transmissions API`_ to send a friendly test message:

.. code-block:: python

    from sparkpost import SparkPost

    sp = SparkPost()

    response = sp.transmissions.send(
        use_sandbox=True,
        recipients=['someone@somedomain.com'],
        html='<p>Hello world</p>',
        from_email='test@sparkpostbox.com',
        subject='Hello from python-sparkpost'
    )

    print(response)
    # outputs {u'total_accepted_recipients': 1, u'id': u'47960765679942446', u'total_rejected_recipients': 0}

.. _transmissions API: https://www.sparkpost.com/api#/reference/transmissions

Django Integration
------------------
The SparkPost python library comes with an email backend for Django. Put the following configuration in `settings.py` file.

.. code-block:: python

    SPARKPOST_API_KEY = 'API_KEY'
    SPARKPOST_BASE_URI = 'api.sparkpost.com'
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'sparkpost.django.email_backend.SparkPostEmailBackend'

Replace *API_KEY* with an actual API key that you've generated in `Get a Key`_ section. Check out the `full documentation`_ on the Django email backend.

If you are using an EU account, set *SPARKPOST_BASE_URI* to `api.eu.sparkpost.com`. The default value is `api.sparkpost.com`.

.. _full documentation: https://python-sparkpost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/django/backend.html

Using with Google Cloud
-----------------------
There are a few simple modifications necessary to enable the use of the underlying ``requests`` library that python-sparkpost uses. First, add the ``requests`` and ``requests-toolbelt`` to your project's ``requirements.txt``:

.. code-block::

    requests
    requests-toolbelt

Then create or update your ``appengine_config.py`` file to include the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import requests_toolbelt.adapters.appengine

    requests_toolbelt.adapters.appengine.monkeypatch()

Then deploy your app and you should be able to send using python-sparkpost on Google Cloud.
